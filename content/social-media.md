# Introduction to social media

> As such we provide an introduction for those unfamiliar and to create a shared language for certain terms.

## What is social media?

The exact definition of "social media" is unclear.
The "social" part is about a collectives that have interaction, while the "media" is about tools that deliver information. 
So if you ever participated on a forum, or wrote an e-mail, or wrote a grocery list, then you already have done some form of social media.

## How can social media be used?

Social media can be used for different goals: Idle talk, discussions, collaberation, relations (work/love/et cetera), news, business and so on.

- "Centralized Network": An online network that is owned/operated by a single party (examples: Twitter/Facebook)
- "Instance": ???
- "Federated Network": A network where instances are decentralized and distributed across multiple parties.
- "Distributed Network": See "Federated Network"
